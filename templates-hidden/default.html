      <p class="introduction">
        We are a group of software engineers who believe that a governments in the 21st centruy are at their best
        when they are held accountable to their citizens. We believe that the best way to enable that accountability
        is to make the barrier to accessing information about government as low as possible. Projects that fly
        under our banner all have this mission. We are non-partisian and not exclusive, so if you believe as we do
        then please get in touch.
